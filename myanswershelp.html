        <h1>How to View Your RMA Tickets &amp; Q&amp;A</h1>
        <p>
            On your <strong>My RMA Tickets &amp; Q&amp;A</strong> page, you can see all of your Return Merchandise
            Authorization (RMA) requests alongside any questions you’ve asked through our Q&amp;A system.
            This page is only accessible once you’ve logged in as a member.
        </p>
        <p>
            The page is divided into two main sections:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>My RMA Tickets</strong> – Displays each of your RMA requests, including ticket ID,
                order item IDs, issue type, a brief description, any attached documentation,
                and whether the admin has responded yet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>My Questions &amp; Answers</strong> – Shows all your submitted questions, the date
                each question was asked, and whether it has been answered by our support team.
                If answered, the response will be displayed underneath your original question.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you notice that an RMA or question has not been answered yet, please allow our team some time
            to review your request. You’ll see an “Awaiting admin response” or “Your question is being reviewed”
            status until we address it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For further help regarding your account or our services, feel free to contact our support team.
